## The Application's information
This is an advanced weather forecast application which has the implementaton of a fullstack skills by having both login and signup for existing and new users. The application is mobile responsive and interactive as it displays location searched region on an integrated map with the wether information of the region, the appliction displays the weather information of a random city on login while also displaying the weather information of the searched region when users makes their search. The application implements <b>Json web tokens(JWT)</b> to generate user's <b>access token and refresh tokens</b>. The backend was built using Node JS and <b>Express JS</b>, while the frontend relies on the use of the great <b>React JS</b> and <b>MongoDB</b> as database respectively.

<!-- # Getting Started with Advanced weather forecast application
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). -->

# Instructions to run the application
## Available Backend Scripts

###  `npm start`
In the application directory, create a .env file and store the following enviroment variables.
<li>REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET</li>
<li>ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET</li>
<li>DB_CONNECT_URI</li>
<br />
<b>REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET</b> and <b>ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET</b> can have random texts stored in them, as they are used to create access and refresh tokens which will be used later for validating user login. <b>DB_CONNECT_URI</b> gets the link of the <b>MonogoDB</b> database stored in it.
<br /> 

Navigate to the project directory on your terminal and run this script, this spin up the backend application on your local browser with [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) 



## Available Frontend Scripts

In the frontend project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

<!-- See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information. -->

<!-- ### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it. -->
